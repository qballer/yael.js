Run Time mechanizm:

Serving new clients.
	- Giving them client.js - Static 
	- Giving them Adming.js - Static 

I'm createing slices.
	- Write it to a db. 
	- Given slice to Client. 	

Getting Results.
	-Write to DB. 
	-Feeding the assmebler. 

Serving final result.
	- Batch Time - No algorithm is running. 
			
Uploading ALgorithm  (There is no algorithm running)
	- Validate plugin
	- create browser unit. 
	- Route URL.
	- Route slice serving 
	- Route result aggrigation 

Real Time pile: 
	- Give Page:  Just Serv.(Client or Admin). (Not a pile handded by Express) 
	- Give Slice: Do I have one handy? Serv : Create and Serv.
	- Get Result: Write it to DB, add to batch loading. 
	- Feed Result: 


Batch Time piles : 
	- Agrigrate Result. Feed Results, read from a result from DB. 
	- Create Slice if a pile isn't marked as done, read slices from DB.

Slice Pile: Created from user calledback with a ready slice. 
Result Pile
